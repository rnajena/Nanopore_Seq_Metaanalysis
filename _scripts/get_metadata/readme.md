## How to extract metadata
Based on the MinKNOW version different metadate output files are generated. Different run statistics can be extracted from them by using the following short scripts.

* `get_runid.sh` extract flow cell id and run id from the final summary file
* `get_estimated_bases.sh` extract number of estimated bases sequenced from the throghput file
